> This project is created days ago, but the code was added many years ago when I learnt Android for few months. So this project may contains many bugs and crashes and there is nothing you could learn from it. I strongly don't recommend you use this project. The main reason that I upload this project is that I don't want to keep in my local storage. Even it has bugs, it still the memory for my studing and researching. I really miss days passed by :D
